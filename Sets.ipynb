    "## 1. What is a Set?\n",
    "---\n",
    "The Set Theory is a branch of Mathematics that deals with well defined collections of objects called \"Sets\". Set Theory emerged in the later part of 19th century and soon became a formal mathematical discipline. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Set** is a basic mathematical entity that represents a well defined collection of objects, called **Elements** of the set. Elements of a set have some common attribute or follow a common rule. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Set Notation \n",
    "In order to create a Set, we first specify a common attribute (or a rule) and then gather up all the elements that have this comonality. According to \"Roaster Notation\", elements of a Set are shown as a list inside curly braces, separated by a comma. Capital letters are used to denote sets. Lets see some simple examples of sets: \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:** An example of a very simple Set would be \"A set of whole numbers between 2 and 5 inclusive\". Using set notation mentioned above, we can formally present this Set as **A = {2, 3, 4, 5}**. Here A is the name of the Set containing the elements 2, 3, 4 and 5 (following the given rule). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2:** A Set of all fingers on a hand can be shown as **H = {thumb, index, middle, ring, pinky}**. Here H (used for hand) is a Set containing elements thumb, index, middle, ring and pinky. These elements share a common property i.e. belonging to a hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets can be \"finite\" or \"infinite\". Above examples show finite sets having finite (countable) number of elements. An infinite set can be expressed as \"A set of even numbers\" and formally presented as ** E = {2, 4, 6, 8, ...}.** Puting three dots towards the end of list means that this list goes on forever OR the list is \"infinite\". \n",
    "\n",
    "#### NOTE 1####  \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that while desribing elements within a set, there should not be any ambiguity in the description of elements. This is to ensure that the set remains \"well defined\". For example, to mention *\"A set of top 10 pop singers\"* may cause ambiguity as this description would involve subjective judgement and different individuals will produce different sets according their to their subjective preferences.  \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, describing a set as *\"A set of top 10 pop singers in 2018, according to Rolling Stones\"* removes any ambiguity and would always refer to same set. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### NOTE 2####  \n",
    "\n",
    "In formal set theory *\"Each Element in a set is a unique entity\"*.This means that repetition or order of elements within a Set do not change the nature of that set e.g. following lists describe the same Set A shown above <br>\n",
    "{2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5} = {5, 4, 3, 2} = {2, 5, 3, 4, 3} \n",
    "\n",
    "### A Formal Definition ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Georg Cantor (1874 - 1918), founder of Set theory described a set as \n",
    "\n",
    ">*\"A set is a gathering together into a whole of definite, distinct objects of our perception and of our thought - which are called elements of the set\"* \n",
    "\n",
    "which, in simple terms means \"a collection of objects\" as we described earlier. \n"

    "## 2. Sets in Python \n",
    "---\n",
    "Python defines a Set as an *\"un-ordered collection of elements, where each element is unique and immutable\"*<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Immutability\" refers to the property that elements of an object can not be changed after it is created. Sets themselves are mutable and we can add or remove elements even after creating a set. Python uses a datatype called `set` which fulfills the Set properties as forally defined by the Set Theory. Unlike list and tuple datatypes in python, the set datatype does not allow multiple occurances of same element. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Creating a Set\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets can be created in python using the Roaster notation mentioned earlier i.e. identifying a Set name and placing all elements inside curly brackets, separated by commas. The built in function `set()` can also be used to achieve the same functionality and allows creation of sets from lists. Lets try creating the sets from our examples. "

Another way to understand the Symmetric difference operation is that it performs a **\"UNION without INTERSECTION\"**. In Python, Symmetric Difference is performed using the `^` operator, or by using `symmetric_difference()` method. Lets look at an example to see this in action using sets from previous examples."

    "A \"Frozen Set\" is an immutable version of Python `set` datatype and is defined using the method `frozenset()`. As we saw in our examples before, we can easily add or remove elements of a `set` datatype in Python because it remains mutable. In contrast, elements of a frozen set remain the same after creation and can not be changed in any way. This allows frozen sets to be used for keys in `dict` datatypes and makes these sets \"hashable\" i.e. a frozen set has a hash value which does not change during its lifetime. \n",

    "At this point, you may be wondering why do you need to know sets and operations that are performed on sets. As seen in the examples above, they may appear very simple and at time, utterly pointless. Sets are a fundamental property of Mathematics and provide foundations for creating other complex data structures.  Here are some examples of the use of Set Theory and relevant Mathematics that are central to the Computer Science and Data Science domains. The further reading section provides links to resources which will allow you to dig deeper into the applications of Set theory in modern computing practices. \n",

So in essence, relational databases store, retrieve and communicate data as sets.(Think SQL for communicating with relation databases)\n",

    "4. In logic and formal language theory, a formal language can be described as a Set of strings with defined operations. These include spoken languages, computer languages and formal logic (propositional logic, 1st/2nd order logic etc.). Algorithms used to study inferencing in formal languages can be seen as setting constraints upon these sets which define the semantics of a language. (Think Natural Language Processing) \n",
